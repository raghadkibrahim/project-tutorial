    "text": "The AI Case Viability Analyst is an intelligent legal assistant designed to evaluate the likelihood of success in potential lawsuits. It functions as an AI-powered case assessment system that mimics a lawyer’s initial case evaluation process. By analyzing the client’s intake packet—including narrative descriptions, supporting documents, contracts, communications, and evidence—it produces a comprehensive legal viability report that quantifies the strength of the case, predicts outcomes, and provides actionable recommendations.\nThe system is trained on historical verdict data, national legislation, legal precedents, and domain-specific reasoning models, ensuring its analysis aligns with actual judicial reasoning patterns.\n\nProduct Vision\nTo provide lawyers, legal consultants, and clients with an objective, data-driven, and explainable evaluation of case viability—reducing time spent on initial assessments, minimizing bias, and enhancing decision-making accuracy in the early stages of litigation.\nVision Statement: “To empower legal professionals with AI-driven insight that transforms subjective case evaluation into data-backed decision-making.”",
