# Input: Client Intake Packet

The system ingests the same materials a lawyer would review in an initial consultation:

- Client’s written summary of the issue (facts, timeline claims, opposing parties).

- Uploaded documents: Contracts, emails, letters, invoices, employment records, etc.

- Metadata and contextual details: Jurisdiction, date of incident, parties involved, claim type, amount in dispute.

- Optional structured intake form: Dropdown fields for dispute category, employment type, breach type, etc.


- **Primary dataset:** Dubai Court verdicts CSV (≈217k rows).
- **Linked lookup:** `case_subtype_code` → subtype labels (external dataset).

> We track download URIs and hashes so we can prove provenance.
