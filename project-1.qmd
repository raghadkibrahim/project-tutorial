title: Project I - Case Similarity Search Engine 
---

This project builds a legalâ€‘AI stack around Dubai court verdicts. 

Objectives:

1. Clean and structure raw verdicts (facts, reasoning, verdict, statutes).
2. Build retrieval and analytics pipelines.
3. Evaluate embeddings and LLMs for precedent search and drafting.
4. Ship a transparent, reproducible pipeline.

I use Python in most chapters; code is baked into the pages, with caches for reproducibility.
